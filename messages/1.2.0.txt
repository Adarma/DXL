Added a Context Menu command "Copy File As Include".
It will place the #include <..> statement for the current file on the clipboard.

You may add additional menus or keybindings allowing you to modify the path that is copied.

In the following example, the local git repo path is changed to a server path.
Put this in 'Packages\User\Context.sublime-menu':

[
	{
		"id": "ServerInclude",
		"caption": "Copy Server File As Include",
		"command": "copy_file_as_include",
		"args": {"change": "C:\\GIT\\", "to": "\\\\SomeServer\\"}
	}
]

The following example adds a shortcut key for the command
Add this to 'Preferences >> Key Bindings - User':

	{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+c"], "command": "copy_file_as_include" }


In the following example a shortcut key combination is added to copy with the drive letter changed.
Add this to 'Preferences >> Key Bindings - User':

	{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+c"], "command": "copy_file_as_include", "args": { "change": "C:", "to": "Z:" } }
