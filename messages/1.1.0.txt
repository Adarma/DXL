Preprocessor //<Requires> directives may be used at the top of the code.

These should have the syntax:
//<Requires>  #include <C:\path\to\an\include.inc>	// Optional comment to describe why it is required

These includes are linted and run when executed from SublimeText.
It allows you to easily work on inculdes which require other includes, when you don't use nested includes.
